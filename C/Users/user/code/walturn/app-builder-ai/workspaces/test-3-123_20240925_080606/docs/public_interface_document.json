{"package_name":"com.example.cat_dog_app","project_description":"A simple Flutter application that demonstrates state management using the Cubit pattern. The app has a single screen that displays a text with an icon. Clicking the text toggles between 'Cat' with a clock icon and 'Dog' with a person icon.","architecture_overview":"The project follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns. State management is handled using the Cubit pattern, keeping the business logic separate from the UI. The app is divided into folders for screens, cubits, models, and widgets.","folder_structure":{"lib":{"main.dart":{},"cubits":{"animal_cubit.dart":{}},"models":{"animal_model.dart":{}},"screens":{"home_screen.dart":{}},"widgets":{"animal_text_widget.dart":{}}}},"files":[{"name":"lib/main.dart","description":"The entry point of the application.
